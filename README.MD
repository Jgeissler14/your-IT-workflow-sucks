# Ansible Getting Started Guide

## Introduction
Ansible is a simple and powerful automation tool that can help you manage configurations, deployments, and more, across a wide variety of systems. It uses human-readable YAML files to define automation tasks and can be used to manage servers, applications, and services. In this guide, weâ€™ll walk through setting up Ansible on your local machine and running your first command to automate tasks.

## Requirements

- Ansible installed on your local machine
- A basic understanding of the command line
- (Optional) AWS EC2 instance for a real-world scenario demo

## Steps to get started with Ansible

1. **Install Ansible**

   On Ubuntu-based systems:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install ansible
   ```

   On macOS (using Homebrew):
   ```
   brew install ansible
   ```

2. **Create Your First Ansible Playbook**

   Let's start by creating a simple playbook. Create a file named `playbook.yaml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
    ---
    - name: Install Nginx web server
      become: yes
      hosts: all
      tasks:
      - name: Ensure Nginx is installed
        yum:
          name: nginx
          state: present
   ```

   This playbook will install Nginx on your local machine using the `apt` module.

3. **Run the Playbook**

   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you saved `playbook.yaml
   `. Then run:

   ```
   ansible-playbook playbook.yaml
   
   ```

   You should see Ansible connecting to your localhost and installing Nginx.

4. **Using Ansible with AWS EC2**

   To use Ansible with an EC2 instance, you can use the following:

   - First, make sure you have an EC2 instance running and accessible via SSH.
   - Then, create a new file called `hosts.ini` with the IP address of your EC2 instance:

     ```
     [ec2]
     54.123.45.67 ansible_ssh_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/my-ec2-key.pem
     ```

   - Now, update the playbook to install a package (e.g., `nginx`) on the EC2 instance instead of `localhost`. Modify your `playbook.yaml
   ` like this:

     ```yaml
     ---
     - name: Install Nginx web server on EC2
       hosts: ec2
       tasks:
         - name: Ensure Nginx is installed
           apt:
             name: nginx
             state: present
     ```

5. **Run the Playbook on EC2**

   Run the playbook on the EC2 instance with the following command:

   ```
   ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini playbook.yaml
   
   ```

   This command will apply the playbook to your EC2 instance, installing Nginx on it.

## Helpful Ansible Commands

Here are some commonly used Ansible commands:

- `ansible --version` - Check the version of Ansible installed
- `ansible-playbook playbook.yaml` - Run an Ansible playbook
- `ansible -m ping localhost` - Ping localhost to test connectivity
- `ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini playbook.yaml --check` - Perform a dry run of a playbook

## Next Steps

- Learn more about writing complex playbooks and tasks
- Explore using Ansible with multiple EC2 instances or other cloud providers
- Automate entire server setups and application deployments
- Integrate Ansible with CI/CD pipelines for automatic configuration management
